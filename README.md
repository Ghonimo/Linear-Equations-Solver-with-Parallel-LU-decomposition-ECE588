## Building the Project

The project includes a Makefile for easy compilation of the source code into executable binaries. You can use the following commands to build the project:

- To build all versions of the solver (sequential, parallel, and parallel with pivoting):
  ```bash
  make all
   ```
- To build specific versions of the solver, use one of the following commands:
For the sequential version:
   ```bash
   make sequential
   ```
- For the parallel version without pivoting:
   ```bash
   make parallel
   ```
- For the parallel version with pivoting:
   ```bash
   make pivoting
   ```
